Hopefully this works for you. It's not made to be run as is. No warranty made as is. If you end up nuking your collection, that's your fault, but you can hire me to fix it :)

To setup:
yarn install
Fill out the .env-example, save it as .env
Make sure you fill out the rest of the stuff.
Make sure you have the hashLists directory, and put your hashlist in there.

To run:
ts-node update.ts
